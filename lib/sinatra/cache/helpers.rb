module Sinatra
  # = Sinatra::Cache
  #
  # A Sinatra Extension that makes Page and Fragment Caching easy wthin your Sinatra apps.
  #
  # == Installation
  #
  #   #  Add RubyGems.org (former Gemcutter) to your RubyGems sources
  #   $  gem sources -a http://rubygems.org
  #
  #   $  (sudo)? gem install sinatra-cache
  #
  # == Dependencies
  #
  # This Gem depends upon the following:
  #
  # === Runtime:
  #
  # * sinatra ( >= 1.0.a )
  #
  # Optionals:
  #
  # * sinatra-settings[http://github.com/kematzy/sinatra-settings] (>= 0.1.1) # to view default settings in a browser display.
  #
  # === Development & Tests:
  #
  # * rspec (>= 1.3.0 )
  # * rack-test (>= 0.5.3)
  # * rspec_hpricot_matchers (>= 0.1.0)
  # * sinatra-tests (>= 0.1.6)
  # * fileutils
  # * sass
  # * ostruct
  # * yaml
  # * json
  #
  #
  # == Getting Started
  #
  # To start caching your app's ouput, just require and register
  # the extension in your sub-classed Sinatra app:
  #
  #   require 'sinatra/cache'
  #
  #   class YourApp < Sinatra::Base
  #
  #     # NB! you need to set the root of the app first
  #     set :root, '/path/2/the/root/of/your/app'
  #
  #     register(Sinatra::Cache)
  #
  #     set :cache_enabled, true  # turn it on
  #
  #     <snip...>
  #
  #   end
  #
  #
  # That's more or less it.
  #
  # You should now be caching your output by default, in <tt>:production</tt> mode, as long as you use
  # one of Sinatra's render methods:
  #
  #   erb(),  erubis(), haml(), sass(), builder(), etc..
  #
  # ...or any render method that uses <tt>Sinatra::Templates#render()</tt> as its base.
  #
  #
  #
  # == Configuration Settings
  #
  # The default settings should help you get moving quickly, and are fairly common sense based.
  #
  #
  # === <tt>:cache_enabled</tt>
  #
  # This setting toggles the cache functionality On / Off.
  # Default is: <tt>false</tt>
  #
  #
  # === <tt>:cache_environment</tt>
  #
  # Sets the environment during which the cache functionality is active.
  # Default is: <tt>:production</tt>
  #
  #
  # === <tt>:cache_page_extension</tt>+
  #
  # Sets the default file extension for cached files.
  # Default is: <tt>.html</tt>
  #
  #
  # === <tt>:cache_output_dir</tt>
  #
  # Sets cache directory where the cached files are stored.
  # Default is:  == "/path/2/your/app/public"
  #
  # Although you can set it to the more ideal '<tt>..public/system/cache/</tt>'
  # if you can get that to work with your webserver setup.
  #
  #
  # === <tt>:cache_fragments_output_dir</tt>
  #
  # Sets the directory where cached fragments are stored.
  # Default is the '../tmp/cache_fragments/' directory at the root of your app.
  #
  # This is for security reasons since you don't really want your cached fragments publically available.
  #
  #
  # === <tt>:cache_fragments_wrap_with_html_comments</tt>
  #
  # This setting toggles the wrapping of cached fragments in HTML comments. (see below)
  # Default is: <tt>true</tt>
  #
  #
  # === <tt>:cache_logging</tt>
  #
  # This setting toggles the logging of various cache calls. If the app has access to the <tt>#logger</tt> method,
  # curtesy of Sinatra::Logger[http://github.com/kematzy/sinatra-logger] then it will log there, otherwise logging
  # is silent.
  #
  # Default is: <tt>true</tt>
  #
  #
  # === <tt>:cache_logging_level</tt>
  #
  # Sets the level at which the cache logger should log it's messages.
  # Default is: <tt>:info</tt>
  #
  # Available options are: [:fatal, :error, :warn, :info, :debug]
  #
  #
  # == Basic Page Caching
  #
  # By default caching only happens in <tt>:production</tt> mode, and via the Sinatra render methods, erb(), etc,
  #
  # So asuming we have the following setup (continued from above)
  #
  #
  #   class YourApp
  #
  #     <snip...>
  #
  #     set :cache_output_dir, "/full/path/2/app/root/public/system/cache"
  #
  #     <snip...>
  #
  #     get('/') { erb(:index) }            # => is cached as '../index.html'
  #
  #     get('/contact') { erb(:contact) }   # => is cached as '../contact.html'
  #
  #     # NB! the trailing slash on the URL
  #     get('/about/') { erb(:about) }      # => is cached as '../about/index.html'
  #
  #     get('/feed.rss') { builder(:feed) }  # => is cached as '../feed.rss'
  #     # NB! uses the extension of the passed URL,
  #     # but DOES NOT ensure the format of the content based on the extension provided.
  #
  #     # complex URL with multiple possible params
  #     get %r{/articles/?([\s\w-]+)?/?([\w-]+)?/?([\w-]+)?/?([\w-]+)?/?([\w-]+)?/?([\w-]+)?}  do
  #       erb(:articles)
  #     end
  #     # with the '/articles/a/b/c  => is cached as ../articles/a/b/c.html
  #
  #     # NB! the trailing slash on the URL
  #     # with the '/articles/a/b/c/  => is cached as ../articles/a/b/c/index.html
  #
  #     # CSS caching via Sass  # => is cached as '.../css/screen.css'
  #     get '/css/screen.css' do
  #       content_type 'text/css'
  #       sass(:'css/screen')
  #     end
  #
  #     # to turn off caching on certain pages.
  #     get('/dont/cache/this/page') { erb(:aview, :cache => false) }   # => is NOT cached
  #
  #
  #     # NB! any query string params - [ /?page=X&id=y ] - are stripped off and TOTALLY IGNORED
  #     # during the caching process.
  #
  #   end
  #
  # OK, that's about all you need to know about basic Page Caching right there. Read the above example
  # carefully until you understand all the variations.
  #
  #
  # == Fragment Caching
  #
  # If you just need to cache a fragment of a page, then you would do as follows:
  #
  #   class YourApp
  #
  #     set :cache_fragments_output_dir, "/full/path/2/fragments/store/location"
  #
  #   end
  #
  # Then in your views / layouts add the following:
  #
  #   <% cache_fragment(:name_of_fragment) do %>
  #    # do something worth caching
  #   <% end %>
  #
  #
  # Each fragment is stored in the same directory structure as your request
  # so, if you have a request like this:
  #
  #   get '/articles/2010/02' ...
  #
  # ...the cached fragment will be stored as:
  #
  #   ../tmp/cache_fragments/articles/2010/02/< name_of_fragment >.html
  #
  # This enables you to use similar names for your fragments or have
  # multiple URLs use the same view / layout.
  #
  #
  # === An important limitation
  #
  # The fragment caching is dependent upon the final URL, so in the case of
  # a blog, where each article uses the same view, but through different URLs,
  # each of the articles would cache it's own fragment, which is ineffecient.
  #
  # To sort-of deal with this limitation I have temporarily added a very hackish
  # 'fix' through adding a otion parameter (see example below), which will store
  # fragment cache to the location below.
  #
  #  ../tmp/cache_fragments/shared/
  #
  # So given the URL:
  #
  #   get '/articles/2010/02/fragment-caching-with-sinatra-cache' ...
  #
  # and the following <tt>#cache_fragment</tt> declaration in your view
  #
  #   <% cache_fragment(:name_of_fragment, shared:, true) do %>
  #     # do something worth caching
  #   <% end %>
  #
  # ...the cached fragment would be stored as:
  #
  #   ../tmp/cache_fragments/shared/< name_of_fragment >.html
  #
  # Any other URLs with would use the same cached fragment.
  #
  #
  #
  # == Cache Expiration
  #
  # When you pass `:expires_in` option, you can set cache expiration time.
  #
  #   <% cache_fragment :name_of_fragment, expires_in: 300 do %>
  #     # do something worth caching
  #   <% end %>
  #
  # If you don't set any, default expiration time is 900 seconds (15 minutes).
  #
  # <b>Under development, and not entirely final.</b> See Todo's below for more info.
  #
  #
  # To expire a cached item - file or fragment - you use the :cache_expire() method.
  #
  #
  #   cache_expire('/contact')  =>  expires ../contact.html
  #
  #
  #   # NB! notice the trailing slash
  #   cache_expire('/contact/')  =>  expires ../contact/index.html
  #
  #
  #   cache_expire('/feed.rss')  =>  expires ../feed.rss
  #
  #
  # To expire a cached fragment:
  #
  #   cache_expire('/some/path', :fragment => :name_of_fragment )
  #
  #     =>  expires ../some/path/:name_of_fragment.html
  #
  #
  #
  # == A few important points to consider
  #
  #
  # === The DANGERS of URL query string params
  #
  # By default the caching ignores the query string params, but that's not the only problem with query params.
  #
  # Let's say you have a URL like this:
  #
  #   /products/?product_id=111
  #
  # and then inside that template [ .../views/products.erb ], you use the <tt>params[:product_id]</tt>
  # param passed in for some purpose.
  #
  #   <ul>
  #     <li>Product ID: <%= params[:product_id] %></li>  # => 111
  #     ...
  #   </ul>
  #
  # If you cache this URL, then the cached file [ ../cache/products.html ] will be stored with that
  # value embedded. Obviously not ideal for any other similar URLs with different <tt>product_id</tt>'s
  #
  # To overcome this issue, use either of these two methods.
  #
  #   # in your_app.rb
  #
  #   # turning off caching on this page
  #
  #   get '/products/' do
  #     ...
  #     erb(:products, :cache => false)
  #   end
  #
  #   # or
  #
  #   # rework the URLs to something like '/products/111 '
  #
  #   get '/products/:product_id' do
  #     ...
  #     erb(:products)
  #   end
  #
  #
  #
  # Thats's about all the information you need to know.
  #
  #
  module Cache
    module Helpers
      ##
      # This method either caches the code fragment and then renders it,
      # or locates the cached fragement and renders that.
      #
      # By default the cached fragement is stored in the ../tmp/cache_fragments/
      # directory at the root of your app.
      #
      # Each fragment is stored in the same directory structure as your request
      # so, if you have a request like this:
      #
      #   get '/articles/2010/02' ...
      #
      # ...the cached fragment will be stored as:
      #
      #   ../tmp/cache_fragments/articles/2010/02/< name_of_fragment >.html
      #
      # This enables you to use similar names for your fragments or have
      # multiple URLs use the same view / layout.
      #
      # ==== Examples
      #
      #   <% cache_fragment(:name_of_fragment) do %>
      #     # do something worth caching
      #   <% end %>
      #
      # === GOTCHA
      #
      # The fragment caching is dependent upon the final URL, so in the case of
      # a blog, where each article uses the same view, but through different URLs,
      # each of the articles would cache it's own fragment.
      #
      # To sort-of deal with this limitation I have added a very hackish 'fix'
      # through adding a 2nd parameter (see example below), which will
      # remove the last part of the URL and use the rest of the URL as
      # the stored fragment path.
      #
      # ==== Example
      #
      # Given the URL:
      #
      #   get '/articles/2010/02/fragment-caching-with-sinatra-cache' ...
      #
      # and the following <tt>#cache_fragment</tt> declaration in your view
      #
      #   <% cache_fragment(:name_of_fragment, :shared) do %>
      #     # do something worth caching
      #   <% end %>
      #
      # ...the cached fragment would be stored as:
      #
      #   ../tmp/cache_fragments/articles/2010/02/< name_of_fragment >.html

      # Any other URLs with the same URL root, like...
      #
      #   get '/articles/2010/02/writing-sinatra-extensions' ...

      # ... would use the same cached fragment.
